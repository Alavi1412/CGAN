Keras implementation of Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets (CGAN)

This is a small repo that implements Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets (CGAN) in Keras. PyTorch implementation will be added soon.

My tutorial on CGAN is also available at: https://medium.com/@ma.bagheri/a-tutorial-on-conditional-generative-adversarial-nets-keras-implementation-694dcafa6282
